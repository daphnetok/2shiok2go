      Card.vue              # Base card component
      StatCard.vue          # KPI statistics card
      ChartCard.vue         # Chart wrapper

- Pet playground extracted for potential reuse

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Smaller files easier to navigate and modify
- Clear component hierarchy
- No duplicate code between dashboards
- Comments removed as requested

### 4. **Props & Events Pattern**
- Parent components control data and state
- Child components emit events for user interactions
- Clean data flow following Vue best practices

### 5. **Consistent Styling**

## Testing Checklist

## Backup Files

Original files backed up as:
- `src/views/HawkerAnalytics.vue.backup` (1,686 lines)
- `src/views/BuyerDashboard.vue.backup` (2,259 lines)

## Next Steps

1. Test all dashboard functionality
2. Integrate Firestore data (as discussed in previous conversation)
3. Add loading states to components
4. Add error boundaries
5. Create unit tests for components
6. Document component APIs

## Notes

- All components follow Vue 3 standards
- HawkerAnalytics uses Options API (consistent with original)
- BuyerDashboard uses Composition API (modern approach)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All features preserved from original implementations
